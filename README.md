## This is an updated version of complexity scoring tools originally developed for spaCy v2, with spaCy v3 out and a need for this for a project our team updated this neat package for spaCy 

## USAGE

You must have a functioning version of spaCy >= 3.0.0

# Download these files:
readability_v_ks.py - this is the actual custom pipeline component/function/class
test.py - shows examples of how to use the functions/pipeline with spaCy on a complex sentence

Put them in the same folder and you can call the f(x) as needed.

The v2 readability has thorogh documentation on how and why the the scripts work. I just added the wrappers, re-organized and re-factored to make it compatible with newere spaCy versions. See original spacy_readability here: https://github.com/mholtzscher/spacy_readability
